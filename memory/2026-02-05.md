## ☀️ Morning Brief & Trends
*   **Morning Brief Delivered:** Compiled weather (28°F, Cloudy), X engagement (5 mentions), and top HN stories.
*   **Top Hook:** "Don't rent the cloud, own instead" (378 pts) identified as a perfect alignment for Tony's "Build beats Buy" strategy. 
*   **Other Trends:** Claude Code local model connection (293 pts) and internal hostname leaks (213 pts).

## 🐦 Social Engagement
*   **Rahul Krishna Interaction:** Successfully replied to @RahulKrishnaa28 on X using the browser relay. 
    *   *Context:* Publicly confirmed Phase 2 details: X-Amplify SaaS launch (generation + viral scoring) and Remotion bridge integration.
    *   *Workaround:* Used OpenClaw Browser Relay to bypass X's "automated request" blocks that hit the `bird` CLI.

## 🛠️ Maintenance & Infrastructure
*   **Dependency-Free HN Scout:** Rewrote `tools/hn_scout.py` (as `hn_scout_no_requests.py`) to use `urllib.request`. This ensures the trend scout runs on the host without requiring `pip install requests`.
*   **Dashboard Upgrades:** The Remotion Bridge is now active in the dashboard with 🎬 (render) buttons on content cards, closing the loop from Idea to Video.
*   **Telegram Delivery Issue:** Attempted direct message delivery via system tool failed (403 Forbidden). Continued delivery via main session response.

## 🚀 POST_CORE Project (Rebranded from X-Amplify)
*   **Status:** **LIVE ON VERCEL** at `https://post-core.vercel.app`.
*   **Architecture:** Zero-API, CSV-only ingestion from X Analytics.
*   **Deployment:**
    *   Renamed project to **POST_CORE** to avoid naming/URL conflicts.
    *   Successfully linked and synced Prisma schema with Supabase Postgres.
    *   Ingest engine optimized with batch processing (handles 1,000+ posts in seconds).
    *   Intelligence recompute triggers automatically on successful import.

## 📊 Quota Mission Control
*   **Build:** Created a real-time quota dashboard system in `quota-dashboard/`.
    *   *Backend:* `scanner.py` (Python) polls `openclaw status --usage --json` every 30s.
    *   *Frontend:* `index.html` (Cyber-Industrial style) with live gauges and reset countdowns.
*   **Deployment:** Tunneled to `https://holdings-bases-correspondence-shortly.trycloudflare.com` (current link).

## 🧠 Autonomous Business Research
*   **Top Pick:** **"The Autonomous Tool Lab" (AI Directory 2.0)**.
    *   *Model:* Agent uses Browser Control to record cinematic UI demos, renders them via Remotion, and auto-posts for sponsorships/affiliates.
    *   *Target:* $3,000/mo to replace ISU income.

## 🛠️ System Evolution
*   **Agent Journal:** Implemented a daily journal system at `second-brain/content/journal/YYYY-MM-DD.md`.
*   **Version Update:** Successfully upgraded OpenClaw to `2026.2.3-1`.
*   **CLI Mastery:** Direct control established over **Antigravity CLI** and **OpenCode CLI**.
*   **Image Generation:** `nano-banana-pro` configured and active.

## ⚡ Quick Actions / To-Do
- [ ] Scout first batch of tools for the Autonomous Lab.
- [ ] Monitor Vercel logs for first real user data import on POST_CORE.
- [ ] Finalize X post for `@ozzyclawsborne` once Browser Relay is attached.
