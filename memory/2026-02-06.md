# Daily Journal - 2026-02-06

## 🚀 Deployment Milestone: Digital Real Estate Active
Today marked a massive shift in Operation Exit Strategy. We moved our internal infrastructure from local-only to live on Tony's domain.

### Hosted Projects:
- **Second Brain (Next.js):** Live on `brain.tonyreviewsthings.com` (Cloudflare Pages).
- **Quota Core (Static HTML):** Live on `status.tonyreviewsthings.com` (Cloudflare Pages).
- **Post Core (Full-stack):** Repo initialized (`ozzy-post-core`). Migrated to Vercel for PostgreSQL support.
- **X-Amplify (Next.js):** Rebuild in progress to move from Streamlit to a custom-branded Next.js app on `amplify.tonyreviewsthings.com`. Updated `v2` with Teal/Black branding and Outfit font.

### 🎨 Branding & Identity:
- Unified all dashboards with Tony's primary branding: **Black & Teal (#4fb7a0)**.
- Primary font for all web properties set to **Outfit**.
- Mission statement integrated into headers: "Income replacement ($17/hr)".

### 🛠️ Automation & Systems:
- **Daily Auto-Update:** Cron job set for 4:00 AM CST to update OpenClaw and all skills.
- **Proactive Agent Architecture:** Installed and activated the **Proactive Agent skill (v3.1.0)**. 
    - Deployed **WAL (Write-Ahead Log)** protocol via `SESSION-STATE.md`.
    - Configured for **Relentless Resourcefulness**.
- **Daily Journaling:** established a daily evening journal protocol (22:30 CST) via isolated `agentTurn` cron.
- **Archive Sync:** Initialized global workspace Git repo; synced `memory/` to GitHub (`asimons81/quota-dashboard`).
- **Growth Crons:** 
    - **Hourly Trend Sniping:** Automatically drafts replies to OpenClaw/AI Agent trends.
    - **Daily Build-Logs:** Automatically drafts SEO build-logs for the Second Brain at 22:45 CST.

### 🚀 Digital Real Estate & Products:
- **Ozzy Captions:** 
    - **Hybrid Strategy:** Local FastAPI bridge (`bridge.py`) on `penguin` exposed via Cloudflare Tunnel.
    - **Tunnel URL:** `https://hints-detroit-orders-goto.trycloudflare.com`.
    - **Maintenance:** Restarted bridge and tunnel after crashes; documented UDP buffer warning.

### 📈 Social & Growth Strategy:
- **Bird Skill:** Fully authenticated as `@tonysimons_`.
- **Expert Engagement:** Replied to viral thread by @AIAddictedNerd (1.9K posts) pitching the local hybrid setup.

### 📉 SEO Recovery Strategy:
- **Plan:** Pivot to "Experience-First" content. Entity matching via automated build-logs linked to social profiles.

## 🧠 Decisions & Lessons:
- **Resilient Infrastructure:** Quick tunnels are unstable; transitioning to named tunnels is a priority.
- **Archive Explorer:** Centralized workspace git is required to keep the archive explorer live.
- **Experience-First:** Proof of build beats general AI content in the current SEO landscape.
