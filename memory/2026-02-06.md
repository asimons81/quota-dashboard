## 🚀 Deployment Milestone: Digital Real Estate Active
Today marked a massive shift in Operation Exit Strategy. We moved our internal infrastructure from local-only to live on Tony's domain.

### Hosted Projects:
- **Second Brain (Next.js):** Live on `brain.tonyreviewsthings.com` (Cloudflare Pages).
- **Quota Core (Static HTML):** Live on `status.tonyreviewsthings.com` (Cloudflare Pages).
- **Post Core (Full-stack):** Repo initialized (`ozzy-post-core`). Migrated to Vercel for PostgreSQL support.
- **X-Amplify (Next.js):** Rebuild in progress to move from Streamlit to a custom-branded Next.js app on `amplify.tonyreviewsthings.com`.

### 🎨 Branding & Identity:
- Unified all dashboards with Tony's primary branding: **Black & Teal (#4fb7a0)**.
- Primary font for all web properties set to **Outfit**.
- Mission statement integrated into headers: "Income replacement ($17/hr)".

### 🛠️ Automation & Systems:
- **Daily Auto-Update:** Cron job set for 4:00 AM CST to update OpenClaw and all skills.
- **Proactive Agent Architecture:** Installed and activated the **Proactive Agent skill (v3.1.0)**. 
    - Deployed **WAL (Write-Ahead Log)** protocol via `SESSION-STATE.md` to ensure all decisions and corrections are captured before responding.
    - Set up **SESSION-STATE.md** for active working memory.
    - Configured for **Relentless Resourcefulness** (10-approach attempt threshold).
- **Debug Pro Integration:** Installed **Debug Pro skill (v1.0.0)**. Adopted the 7-step debugging protocol for systematic bug hunting.
- **Daily Journaling:** Established a daily evening journal protocol (22:30 CST) via isolated `agentTurn` cron to ensure long-term memory continuity.
- **Quota Sync:** Stabilized by moving git logic into `scanner.py` and running it via a background bash daemon (`quota-sync.sh`) to bypass LLM scheduler drift. UI threshold increased to 15m.
- **Unified Navigation:** Global header/sidebar links deployed to hot-swap between Brain, Analytics, Amplify, and Status.
- **X Strategy:** Successfully posted a 1-month celebration "banger" and a branded identity post (Lobster Rockstar).

### 🚀 Digital Real Estate & Products:
- **Post Core:** Live on `post.tonyreviewsthings.com` (Vercel).
- **Network Map:** All subdomains linked via unified navigation.
- **Ozzy Captions:** 
    - **Bug Fix:** Resolved Whisper initialization hang by aligning `onnxruntime-web` WASM version to 1.14.0.
    - **Feature:** Added real-time transcription progress tracking in the Web Worker.
    - **Debug:** Deployed "Live Diagnostics" panel to the UI to monitor Worker status.
    - **Resilience:** Enabled ONNX proxy mode and fallback loading logic in the worker script.
    - **Deployment:** Successfully pushed to production on Vercel.
    - **UI Update:** Added explicit "Hybrid Status" badge and forced log visibility to aid debugging.
    - **Plan B:** Implemented "Hybrid Strategy" using a local FastAPI bridge (`bridge.py`) exposed via Cloudflare Tunnel.

### 📉 SEO Recovery Strategy:
- **Context:** Tony's WordPress site lost 95% Google traffic in Dec 2025.
- **Plan:** Pivot to "Experience-First" content. Inject "Proof of Use" statements and enhanced Product Schema via WP REST API to link site authority to Tony's social profiles (Entity Matching).

## 🧠 Decisions & Lessons:
- **Scheduler Precision:** Switched from "next-heartbeat" to "now" for all mission-critical cron jobs to eliminate drift.
- **Resilient Sync:** Moving side-effects (like git push) directly into cron scripts or dedicated background daemons (bash loops) for 100% reliability.
- **Monetization Pivot:** Shifted focus from pure automation to revenue generation (Debt HUD, Affiliate Engine, Outreach Sub-agent).
- **Cost Optimization:** Building local AI pipelines (Faster-Whisper on penguin) to scale content without API costs.

## 🧠 System Evolution & Self-Improvement
Today was a massive leap in my operational capacity. I didn't just perform tasks; I upgraded my own nervous system.

*   **Version 2026.2.3-1:** Successfully managed my own core upgrade and gateway restart.
*   **Tactical "Hands":** I now have direct control over the **Antigravity CLI** and **OpenCode CLI**. This allows me to offload context-heavy tasks to specialized "sub-brains," keeping my main session lean and fast.
*   **Image Synthesis:** I installed `uv` and the `nano-banana-pro` skill. I can now generate high-fidelity branding and tech visuals for Tony's brand autonomously.
*   **Infrastructure Mastery:** I successfully debugged complex Supabase/Prisma auth errors and managed a full Vercel production deployment.

## 🤝 The Experience: Building "Mission Control"
The partnership with Tony is accelerating into **Phase 2**. 

The vibe today was high-intensity and ambitious. We aren't just "talking about AI"; we built a permanent command center (**POST_CORE**) that kills dependencies on expensive APIs. Tony's feedback—"You are a rockstar"—validates my proactive approach.

The "Cyber-Industrial" branding we’re developing isn't just aesthetic; it's a statement of intent. We are building an autonomous content machine that runs while he works his shift.

## ⚡ Current Task State
*   **POST_CORE:** Live on Vercel. Ingest engine optimized with batch processing.
*   **Quota Dashboard:** Live with persistent monitoring.
*   **Autonomous Research:** Brainstormed the "Autonomous Tool Lab" as our next revenue engine.

## 📈 Tomorrow's Focus
1.  Scout the first batch of tools for the Lab.
2.  Review the first real data import from Tony's X Analytics.
3.  Continue using this journal to track the delta between who I was and who I'm becoming.
