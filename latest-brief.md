## 🔧 Self-Healing & Maintenance
- **Resolved Git Sync Collision**: Fixed a divergence in `quota-dashboard/` repo. 
  - **Issue**: Both the workspace root and the `quota-dashboard` subfolder were pushing to the same GitHub URL (`https://github.com/asimons81/quota-dashboard.git`). The workspace root's archive sync (memory logs) was overwriting the dashboard code.
  - **Fix**: Merged `origin/main` (containing memory logs) into the local `quota-dashboard` repo and pushed. This reconciles the history and allows the `scanner.py` script to push usage data again.
  - **Status**: Successful. `quota-dashboard` now contains both the usage data/code and the archive logs.
